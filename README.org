* Setup
** Dependencies
If you want everything to work out of the box, i highly recommend nixos.
My shell is bash.
Otherwise
+ nix
+ git
+ direnv
+ starship
+ curl

** Install dotfiles
clone repo  to ~/.dotfiles and run gnu stow .

** nix
*** Setup nix
for example to use the desktop config

#+begin_src shell
evolve desktop
#+end_src

** Evolve
`evolve` is a bash function to wrap the nixos rebuild switch so you config can stay in the ~/.dotfiles/ folder.

You can pass other options to it and it will be passed to it, by default it will just use the switch option.
